# What I haved learned
- panels: flex container 
  - panel: flex container
    - item: flex container
      - text

- addEventListener: set up a function which will be called when the event is delivered to the target
```
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick)
```

- `handleClick` will execute in the context of the element on which the event is binded - `this` keyword will be the element

- el.classList.toggle to toggle a class
